      content: `What is Java?
Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.

It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.

It is used for:

Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
Desktop applications
Web applications
Web servers and application servers
Games
Database connection
And much, much more!
Why Use Java?
Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
It has a large demand in the current job market
It is easy to learn and simple to use
It is open-source and free
It is secure, fast and powerful
It has huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa
Get Started
When you are finished with this tutorial, you will be able to write basic Java programs and create real-life examples.

It is not necessary to have any prior programming experience.`,

      content: `Java Syntax
In the previous chapter, we created a Java file called Main.java, and we used the following code to print "Hello World" to the screen:

Main.java

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}

Example explained
Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. And the class name should always start with an uppercase first letter. In our example, we named the class Main.

Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.

The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename. To run the example above on your computer, make sure that Java is properly installed: Go to the Get Started Chapter for how to install Java. The output should be:

Hello World
The main Method
The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:

public static void main(String[] args)
Any code inside the main() method will be executed. Don't worry about the keywords before and after it. You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial.

For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.

System.out.println()
Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen:

public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Hello World");
}

Note: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).

Don't worry too much about how System, out and println() works. Just know that you need them together to print stuff to the screen.

You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).`,

Java Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

ExampleGet your own Java Server
int x = 100 + 50;

Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable:

Example
int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)

Java divides the operators into the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Bitwise operators
Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

Operator	Name	Description	Example	Try it
+	Addition	Adds together two values	x + y	
-	Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another	x - y	
*	Multiplication	Multiplies two values	x * y	
/	Division	Divides one value by another	x / y	
%	Modulus	Returns the division remainder	x % y	
++	Increment	Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	
--	Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x

Java Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

In the example below, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x:

Example
int x = 10;

The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable:

Example
int x = 10;
x += 5;

A list of all assignment operators:

Operator	Example	  Same As	
  =	         x = 5	  x = 5	
  +=	     x += 3	  x = x + 3	
  -=	     x -= 3   x = x - 3	
  *=	     x *= 3   x = x * 3	
  /=	     x /= 3	  x = x / 3	
%=	         x %= 3	  x = x % 3	
&=	         x &= 3	  x = x & 3	
|=         	 x |= 3	  x = x | 3	
^=	         x ^= 3	  x = x ^ 3	
>>=	         x >>= 3  x = x >> 3	
<<=	         x <<= 3  x = x << 3	
Java Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

The return value of a comparison is either true or false. These values are known as Boolean values, and you will learn more about them in the Booleans and If..Else chapter.

In the following example, we use the greater than operator (>) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:

Example
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
System.out.println(x > y); // returns true, because 5 is higher than 3

Operator	Name	                 Example	
==	       Equal to	                    x == y	
!=	       Not equal	                x != y	
>	       Greater than             	x > y	
<	        Less than               	x < y	
>=	        Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	        Less than or equal to	    x <= y	
Java Logical Operators
You can also test for true or false values with logical operators.

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:

Operator	Name	Description	Example	Try it
&& 	Logical and	Returns true if both statements are true	x < 5 &&  x < 10	
|| 	Logical or	Returns true if one of the statements is true	x < 5 || x < 4	
!	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	!(x < 5 && x < 10)	
`,
    },
    {
      name: "Java Switch",
      content: `Java Switch Statements
Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the switch statement.

The switch statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed:

SyntaxGet your own Java Server
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
This is how it works:

The switch expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
The break and default keywords are optional, and will be described later in this chapter
The example below uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

Example
int day = 4;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    System.out.println("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    System.out.println("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    System.out.println("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    System.out.println("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    System.out.println("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    System.out.println("Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    System.out.println("Sunday");
    break;
}
// Outputs "Thursday" (day 4)

The break Keyword
When Java reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.

When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.

A break can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores" the execution of all the rest of the code in the switch block.

The default Keyword
The default keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match:

Example
int day = 4;
switch (day) {
  case 6:
    System.out.println("Today is Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    System.out.println("Today is Sunday");
    break;
  default:
    System.out.println("Looking forward to the Weekend");
}
// Outputs "Looking forward to the Weekend"`,
    },
    {
      name: "Java Methods",
      content: `A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.

Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.

Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.

Create a Method
A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses (). Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(), but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:

ExampleGet your own Java Server
Create a method inside Main:

public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    // code to be executed
  }
}
 
Example Explained
myMethod() is the name of the method
static means that the method belongs to the Main class and not an object of the Main class. You will learn more about objects and how to access methods through objects later in this tutorial.
void means that this method does not have a return value. You will learn more about return values later in this chapter
Call a Method
To call a method in Java, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon;

In the following example, myMethod() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:

Example
Inside main, call the myMethod() method:

public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("I just got executed!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
  }
}

// Outputs "I just got executed!"
 

A method can also be called multiple times:

Example
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("I just got executed!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
    myMethod();
    myMethod();
  }
}

// I just got executed!
// I just got executed!
// I just got executed!`,
    },
    {
      name: "Java Recursion",
      content: `Java Recursion

Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

Recursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it.

Recursion Example
Adding two numbers together is easy to do, but adding a range of numbers is more complicated. In the following example, recursion is used to add a range of numbers together by breaking it down into the simple task of adding two numbers:

ExampleGet your own Java Server
Use recursion to add all of the numbers up to 10.

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int result = sum(10);
    System.out.println(result);
  }
  public static int sum(int k) {
    if (k > 0) {
      return k + sum(k - 1);
    } else {
      return 0;
    }
  }
}

Example Explained
When the sum() function is called, it adds parameter k to the sum of all numbers smaller than k and returns the result. When k becomes 0, the function just returns 0. When running, the program follows these steps:

10 + sum(9)
10 + ( 9 + sum(8) )
10 + ( 9 + ( 8 + sum(7) ) )
...
10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + sum(0)
10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0
Since the function does not call itself when k is 0, the program stops there and returns the result.



Halting Condition
Just as loops can run into the problem of infinite looping, recursive functions can run into the problem of infinite recursion. Infinite recursion is when the function never stops calling itself. Every recursive function should have a halting condition, which is the condition where the function stops calling itself. In the previous example, the halting condition is when the parameter k becomes 0.

It is helpful to see a variety of different examples to better understand the concept. In this example, the function adds a range of numbers between a start and an end. The halting condition for this recursive function is when end is not greater than start:

Example
Use recursion to add all of the numbers between 5 to 10.

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int result = sum(5, 10);
    System.out.println(result);
  }
  public static int sum(int start, int end) {
    if (end > start) {
      return end + sum(start, end - 1);
    } else {
      return end;
    }
  }
}

The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.`,
    },
    {
      name: "Java Classes/Objects",
      content: `Java Classes and Objects

Java is an object-oriented programming language.

Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

Create a Class
To create a class, use the keyword class:

Main.javaGet your own Java Server
Create a class named "Main" with a variable x:

public class Main {
  int x = 5;
}
Remember from the Java Syntax chapter that a class should always start with an uppercase first letter, and that the name of the java file should match the class name.

Create an Object
In Java, an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named Main, so now we can use this to create objects.

To create an object of Main, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword new:

Example
Create an object called "myObj" and print the value of x:

public class Main {
  int x = 5;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}
 

Multiple Objects
You can create multiple objects of one class:

Example
Create two objects of Main:

public class Main {
  int x = 5;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj1 = new Main();  // Object 1
    Main myObj2 = new Main();  // Object 2
    System.out.println(myObj1.x);
    System.out.println(myObj2.x);
  }
}
 
 

Using Multiple Classes
You can also create an object of a class and access it in another class. This is often used for better organization of classes (one class has all the attributes and methods, while the other class holds the main() method (code to be executed)).

Remember that the name of the java file should match the class name. In this example, we have created two files in the same directory/folder:

Main.java
Second.java
Main.java
public class Main {
  int x = 5;
}
Second.java
class Second {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}`,
    },
  ],
};
export default javaData;
